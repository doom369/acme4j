# acme4j

A Java client for the _Automatic Certificate Management Environment_ (ACME) protocol as specified in [RFC 8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555).

ACME is a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.

This Java client helps connecting to an ACME server, and performing all necessary steps to manage certificates.

It is an independent open source implementation that is not affiliated with or endorsed by _Let's Encrypt_.

Latest version: ![maven central](https://shredzone.org/maven-central/org.shredzone.acme4j/acme4j/badge.svg)

## Features

* Fully [RFC 8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) compliant
* Supports the `http-01`, `dns-01` and `tls-alpn-01` challenges
* Supports the [acme-ip draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-ip)
* Supports the [acme-star draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-star) for short-term automatic certificate renewal (experimental)
* Easy to use Java API
* Requires JRE 8 (update 101) or higher
* Built with maven, packages available at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.shredzone.acme4j%22)
* Requires [jose4j](https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home), [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) and [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) as dependencies. If you have other means of generating key pairs and CSRs, you can even do without `acme4j-utils` and Bouncy Castle as dependency.
* Extensive unit and integration tests

## Quick Start

[This source code](acme4j-example/apidocs/src-html/org/shredzone/acme4j/ClientTest.html) gives an example of how to get a TLS certificate with _acme4j_.

You can run the `org.shredzone.acme4j.ClientTest` class in your IDE, with the domains to be registered as parameters. The test client can also be invoked via maven in a command line:

```sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="example.com example.org"
```

By default, the test client registers the domains with the Let's Encrypt staging server via HTTP challenge.

## Modules

_acme4j_ consists of five modules. All modules are [available at Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.shredzone.acme4j) and can easily be added to the dependency list of your project. You can also download the jar files [at GitHub](https://github.com/shred/acme4j/releases/latest).

acme4j-client
:   [`acme4j-client`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.shredzone.acme4j/acme4j-client/latest) is the main module. It contains everything that is required to get certificates for domains. It only requires [jose4j](https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j) and [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/).

    The Java module name is `org.shredzone.acme4j`.

acme4j-utils
:   [`acme4j-utils`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.shredzone.acme4j/acme4j-utils/latest) contains utility classes for creating key pairs, CSRs, and certificates. It requires [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) though.

    The Java module name is `org.shredzone.acme4j.utils`.

acme4j-example
:   This module only contains [an example code](https://shredzone.org/maven/acme4j/acme4j-example/apidocs/src-html/org/shredzone/acme4j/ClientTest.html) that demonstrates how to get a certificate with _acme4j_. It depends on `acme4j-client` and `acme4j-utils`. It is not useful as a dependency in other projects.

acme4j-it
:   [`acme4j-it`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.shredzone.acme4j/acme4j-it/latest) mainly serves as integration test suite for _acme4j_ itself. It is not really useful as a dependency in other projects. However if you write own integration tests using [pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) and [pebble-challtestsrv](https://hub.docker.com/r/letsencrypt/pebble-challtestsrv), you may find the [`challtestsrv` configuration client](https://shredzone.org/maven/acme4j/acme4j-it/apidocs/org/shredzone/acme4j/it/BammBammClient.html) useful in your project.

    The Java module name is `org.shredzone.acme4j.it`.
